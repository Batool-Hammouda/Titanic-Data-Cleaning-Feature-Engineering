# Titanic-Data-Cleaning-Feature-Engineering
This study aims to evaluate the impact of preprocessing techniques on machine learning model  performance using the Titanic dataset. Examining the dataset's structure, changing and cleaning  problematic data, and assessing model performance metrics both before and after preprocessing  are all steps in the scientific method.
